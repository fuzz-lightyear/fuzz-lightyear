# fuzz-lightyear
fuzz-lightyear is a fuzzing framework and CLI tool that makes it easy to test complex systems with async behavior using a simplified model as a reference.

When given the simplest possible reference implementation of your program, fuzz-lightyear will apply random operations to both your actual implementation and your reference implementation, performing validation steps along the way to ensure they're always in sync.

If random operations ever lead to a failure, fuzz-lightyear will first attempt to shorten your test by removing as many operations as possible, then it will generate a failing [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) test for you. It also provides a handful of CLI commands for executing/managing these test cases.

### Examples
We've used fuzz-lightyear internally to find bugs in a handful of tricky data structures. Check out how we used in it in:
1. [The bitfield used in Hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/bitbase/tree/fuzz-based)
2. [A distributed trie implementation](https://github.com/mafintosh/mock-trie)

### Installation
`npm i fuzz-lightyear -g`

### Making a Fuzzer

### Working with Generated Tests


### Configuration
fuzz-lightyear expects your target module to contain a `fuzzing.config.js` file, which can contain the following options:

### CLI Usage
The `fuzz` command provides a list of operations for executing the fuzzer, and for managing generated test cases:

#### `fuzz run`
Perform fuzz testing.

If executed without arguments, `fuzz run` expects the current working directory to contain `fuzzing.js` and `fuzzing.config.js` files. You can also specify these with CLI arguments:
```
--config ./fuzzing.config.js // The path to the fuzzing config file.
--module ./fuzzing.js        // The path to the fuzzing module. 
```

The following additional configuration options can be overriden with CLI arguments:
```
--iterations 2000 // The number of fuzzing iterations to perform.
--opererations 10 // The number of random operations to perform per iteration.
--seed 0          // The starting seed number (this will be incremented after each iteration).
--debug false     // Enable debug logging
--print false     // Only print failing test cases (do not record them as autogenerated tests).
```

#### `fuzz regression`
Run all previously-failing tests (those which have been moved from `tests/autogenerated/failing` to `tests/autogenerated/fixed`)

#### `fuzz failing`
Run all currently-failing tests in `tests/autogenerated/failing`.

#### `fuzz fix`
Move any passing tests in `tests/autogenerated/failing` to `tests/autogenerated/fixed`

#### `fuzz clean`
Remove any untracked
